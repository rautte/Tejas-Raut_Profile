# Tejas Rajendra Raut

I am a 2023 Master of Science graduate from Northeastern University in Engineering Management with a specialization in Data Analytics. I have successfully completed various courses and projects in the field of Finance/Economics, Data Science, Database Management, and Probiblity and Statistics. 

I am thrilled to have the opportunity to introduce myself as a skilled and innovative business/data analyst who is driven by a genuine passion for uncovering hidden insights and empowering strategic decision-making. With 2 years of experience in optimizing finance workflows, developing and monitoring KPIs, and delivering precise investment assessments, my track record captures accomplishments such as a remarkable 25% reduction in financial risk. 

Beyond my analytical prowess, I am a strategic thinker with a creative flair. Armed with advanced tools like Tableau, Python, Javascript, Matlab, Minitab, and Excel, I have the ability to transform raw data into captivating visualizations and actionable insights. By embracing cutting-edge technologies such as robotic process automation (RPA) and harnessing the power of the Internet of Things (IoT), I have successfully steered organizations towards cost savings and efficiency gains, all while leaving a lasting impact on their bottom line.

With an on-going CFA certification and an Applied degree program in Data Science and Business Analytics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, complemented by certifications in Lean-Six Sigma Green Belt, Tableau and AWS Data Analytics, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and strategic acumen to every endeavor.

Thank you for your time.
